REGRESSION PROJECT-

DESCRIPTION-
Dataset contains the house temperature and humidity conditions in different rooms. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network.

OBJECTIVE-
-To predict Appliance energy consumption for a house based on factors like temperature, humidity and pressure
-In order to achieve this, we need to develop a supervised learning model using regression algorithms.
